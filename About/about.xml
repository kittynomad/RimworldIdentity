    Identity adds a variety of features, primarily centered around the Dysphoria system.
    Dysphoria is a pawn's perception of self; traits and genes will make them feel better or worse about themselves.
    Trans pawns, for example, will prefer characteristics that align with their personal identity.
    There are several new traits and genes centered around this system, as well as the Flaren xenotype, with more to come.
    NOTE: It is highly recommended to use More Trait Slots or a similar mod, as 2 of the 3 base trait slots can be taken by gender/dysphoria related traits.
